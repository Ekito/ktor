# Koin 

### What's KOIN?

KOIN is a simple (but powerful) dependency injection framework initially intended for Android developers. It comes without any Android dependency and can be used also by Kotlin developers. 

It uses [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and its functional power to get things done!  No proxy/CGLib, no code generation, no introspection. Just functional Kotlin and DSL magic ;)

KOIN is a very small library, that aims to be as simple as possible and let's you write dependency injection in a breath.


Have a look at the project's [Github repository](https://github.com/Ekito/koin) for more details.
